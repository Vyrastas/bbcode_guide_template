# bbcode_guide_template
BBCode Guide Template for playstationtrophies.org and xboxachievements.com.

The live version of this script can be found here: http://www.vyrastas.com/guide_template.htm

I wrote this script to enable easy creation of trophy / achievement guides in the forums of [playstationtrophies.org](www.playstationtrophies.org) and [xboxachievements.com](www.xboxachievements.com). You select the site and game, copy the resulting BBCode, and fill it in with trophy / achievement explanations. Simples.

Site threads where I originally posted it:

* [PlaystationTrophies](https://www.playstationtrophies.org/forum/guide-central/202570-ultimate-bbcode-trophy-guide-template.html)
* [XboxAchievements](https://www.xboxachievements.com/forum/showthread.php?t=500386)

Here is an example of a guide created with this template: [Sonic Adventure Trophy Guide](https://www.playstationtrophies.org/forum/sonic-adventure/72873-sonic-adventure-trophy-guide.html)
